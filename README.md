# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
# 1.	Overview of the analysis: 
 * The primary purpose of this analysis is to extract data from Amazonâ€™s Vine program and determine if there is bias in the reviews amongst members of this program. 
# 2.	Results: 
* o	How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
# 1.	From the data there are 136 vine user and 18019 nonvine user reviews. 
o	How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
1.	Of the vine users 74 were 5 star and 8482 were non-vine users. 
o	What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
1.	54% of the 5-star users were users and 47% were nonusers. 
3.	Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
o	Based on the results of this analysis it does not appear that is a review bias between users and nonusers. While total reviews for nonusers is significantly smaller than nonusers, the numbers are still closely comparable. It is possible that the number of five-star user reviews would have dropped with a larger sample size of users. 
4.	Additional Analysis
o	This analysis could be run on another data set with a sample size that is closer in number usage to help determine if this conclusion is valid.
