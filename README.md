# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
# 1.	Overview of the analysis: 
 The primary purpose of this analysis is to extract data from Amazonâ€™s Vine program and determine if there is bias in the reviews amongst members of this program. 
# 2.	Results: 
*How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
- From the data there are 136 vine user and 18019 nonvine user reviews. 
*How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- Of the vine users 74 were 5 star and 8482 were non-vine users. 
*What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- 54% of the 5-star users were users and 47% were nonusers. 
# 3.	Summary: .
 Based on the results of this analysis it does not appear that is a review bias between users and nonusers. While total reviews for nonusers is significantly smaller than nonusers, the numbers are still closely comparable. It is possible that the number of five-star user reviews would have dropped with a larger sample size of users. 
# 4.	Additional Analysis
 This analysis could be run on another data set with a sample size that is closer in number usage to help determine if this conclusion is valid.
